# de-moivre

A Clojure library to implement [Abraham de Moivre's "Inclusionâ€“exclusion principle"][1]
applied to probability.

## Usage

This is just an experiment over naive implementations I've made for another
project and will never graduate to anything more than SNAPSHOT.

Please don't use this as a dependency, or just copy/paste the code you're
interested in.
